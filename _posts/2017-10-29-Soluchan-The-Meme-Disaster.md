title: "'Soluchan' &#58; The Meme Disaster"
comments: True

Pitifully, The whole nation now-a-days is focused on an explicit tag called "**Soluchan**". We believe this is something to altercate and Well, This so called thing begins here where a 13 year old boy, Kamlesh from Bhopal has forsaken his mother and also said that he has abandoned his home with a fear of parting way from his addiction towards "Solution" as his mother was strictly against this practice of him. So, almost a few months ago there's this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF3a0P1uRfk) of him circulating on all social media sites. The worse thing here is that people have been making memes on this sensitive issue called ["*Solution abuse*"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2012/08/02/the-childhood-drug-abuse-epidemic-no-one-is-talking-about/#23c3b4c636bf "Harsh reality of solution abuse").


 He assertively said that he started off initially with "Beedi" before moving on to Cigarettes, Tubes and ended up with so called "Solution". He picks up scrap and garbage from the streets and spends 3/4<sup>th</sup> of what he earns on Solution. Also, He is not only addicted to solution but also to Alcohol, Weed, etc.,

So, watching a 13 year old suffer brings joy to you? Is this where our Morale led us to? Is this what "***Developing India***" has become? Are we tagging ourselves as ***Educated Illiterates***?
We believe you have understood the crux here.

Do you think **THAT** really is a **Meme Material?** Are we really supposed to take this issue as some sort of _Mirth_ ? We, The generation of miracles where flying cars are expected are now making Memes on whatever we encounter. Where's our generosity gone? It's really pitiful that these memes are getting viral to this extent. Maybe it's because everyone is suffering and they just want to make sure that people around them suffer even more so that they don't feel **Insecure** anymore.
 
This is not a **Meme Material** and this is not something that should get viral on the internet. Instead of spreading this, Spread the prerequisites that are to be made to ensure the morale values of each and every *Human Being*. "**_Be the change!_**," This is what every one says and Yes! this is the truth where we should change our own mentalities to bring out the colors of happiness!


We can clearly see the biological lifeline he has hold himself to. Consuming all this stuff will lead him no where but will instantly drive him into menacing situations like Anxiety, Loss of memory , Depression, etc., etc., and the list is a long one. All these maladies may eventually lead a child like him to death.

A kid like him should be going to school, Throwing paper rockets at his friends, Having fun and should be dreaming about a better life. We have only seen one such Kamlesh but the thing is that there are so many children in our country doing the same and this is a thing to be worried about.

*This is a heart-breaking reality of our country and now Be The Change To Spread Smiles*
