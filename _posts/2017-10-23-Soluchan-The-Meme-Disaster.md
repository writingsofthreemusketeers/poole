title: "'Soluchan' &#58; The Meme Disaster"

Pitifully, The whole nation now-a-days is focused on an explicit tag called "**Soluchan**". We believe this is something to altercate and Well, This so called thing begins here where a 13 year old boy, Kamlesh from Bhopal has forsaken his mother and also said that he has abandoned his home with a fear of parting way from his addiction towards "Solution" as his mother was strictly against this practice of him. So, almost a few months ago there's this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF3a0P1uRfk) of him circulating on all social media sites. The worse thing here is that people have been making memes on this sensitive issue called ["*Solution abuse*"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2012/08/02/the-childhood-drug-abuse-epidemic-no-one-is-talking-about/#23c3b4c636bf "Harsh reality of solution abuse").


 He assertively said that he started off initially with "Beedi" before moving on to Cigarettes, Tubes and ended up with so called "Solution". He picks up scrap and garbage from the streets and spends 3/4<sup>th</sup> of what he earns on Solution. Also, He is not only addicted to solution but also to Alcohol, Weed, etc.,


So watching a 13 year old suffer brings joy to you? Is this where our Morale led us to? Is this what "***Developing India***" has become? Are we tagging ourselves as ***Educated Illiterates***?
We believe you have understood the crux here.

We can clearly see the biological lifeline he has hold himself to. Consuming all this stuff will lead him no where but will instantly drive him into menacing situations like Anxiety, Loss of memory , Depression, etc., etc., and the list is a long one. All these maladies may eventually lead a child like him to death.

A kid like him should be going to school, Throwing paper rockets at his friends, Having fun and should be dreaming about a better life. We have only seen one such Kamlesh but the thing is that there are so many children in our country doing the same and this is a thing to be worried about, Not about making it a **Meme Material**.

*This is a heart-breaking reality of our country.*
